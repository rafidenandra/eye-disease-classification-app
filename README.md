Final Project (PA) | Rafi Denandra | 2110191048 | D4 Informatics Engineering (2019-2023)

## How This Project Works
This repo comes up with 3 different directories. All of the data exploratory, data preparation, and data modeling is in the 'deep-learning-model' folder. 
The app itself is divided into backend and frontend side. I'm using Flask v2.2.2 for the backend side and Vite-ReactJS v18.2.0. You can run
the app using Anaconda3 or other similar tools.


1. Install Anaconda3 and create conda environment with python 3.9
2. Install important libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, Flask, Flask-Cors

    > :memo: In order to run the app, you'll need to install Flask v2.2.2 and Werkzeug v2.2.2 or v.2.2.3. Usually, when you install Flask with the specified v2.2.2 version, Werkzeug v2.2.3 is also included.

3. Install CUDA, cuDNN, and Tensorflow v2.10 in anaconda

   > :information_source: Follow the tutorial in this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-native).

4. Run 'transfer_learning_2_mixed_resnet50 (final).ipynb'
